# üîê Password Strength & Breach Checker

## ‚úÖ Overview

This is a simple yet powerful **Password Strength & Breach Checker** tool built in Python, designed to run on **Google Colab**.  
It allows users to:
1. Check the strength of passwords based on common security rules.
2. Detect if a password has appeared in known data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Interactive: User inputs passwords directly.
- ‚úÖ Password strength analysis:
    - Minimum length check (‚â• 8 characters).
    - Uppercase letter presence.
    - Number inclusion.
    - Special character inclusion.
- ‚úÖ Breach detection using k-anonymity method (efficient & secure).
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing for fast multiple password checks.
- ‚úÖ Displays progress with a progress bar.
- ‚úÖ Presents final results in a clean tabular format.

## ‚ö° How to Use

1. Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Copy & paste the code into a new notebook.
3. Run the notebook.
4. Enter the number of passwords you want to check.
